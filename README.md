## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze an advertising dataset to identify which platforms yield the best results. We utilize various statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, visualizations, and hypothesis testing techniques. The main goal is to provide actionable insights into advertising effectiveness.

## Data Description

The dataset contains information about different advertising platforms, their spending, and the corresponding outcomes. Key features include:

- **Platform**: The advertising platform used (e.g., Facebook, Google, Twitter).
- **Spend**: Amount spent on advertising.
- **Outcome**: Measured success of the advertising campaign (e.g., sales, clicks).

## Statistical Methods Used

### Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize the main features of the dataset. We calculate measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand the data's central tendency and dispersion.

### Visualizations

Visualizations help to illustrate the relationships within the data. We use various plots, including:

- **Bar Charts**: To compare the effectiveness of different advertising platforms.
- **Box Plots**: To visualize the distribution of outcomes across platforms.
- **Histograms**: To show the frequency distribution of advertising spend.

### Inferential Analysis

Inferential analysis helps us draw conclusions from the sample data. We apply several hypothesis testing techniques:

- **ANOVA Test**: To compare means across multiple groups.
- **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: A non-parametric alternative to ANOVA.
- **Permutation Test**: To assess the significance of the observed data.
- **Post-hoc Analysis**: To identify specific group differences after ANOVA.
